I am a Visual Studio Code user for the last 2 years, but sometimes when I want to quickly edit a text file I am using vim. More specificly Neovim. 
In this post series I would like to document my Neovim configuration along with the steps to install and configure for different tasks that you would perform with Neovim. 
Mostly I am using Neovim for editing text files and small python projects, therefore I have a minimum configuration for all these tasks. 

More details regarding Neovim can be found at https://neovim.io. Below I will enumerate the steps I use to install Neovim on Windwos. 

**Step 1: Install Neovim using chocolatey**
```bash
choco install neovim --pre
```
