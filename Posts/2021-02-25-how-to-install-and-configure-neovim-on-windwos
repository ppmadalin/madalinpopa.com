I’ve been a Visual Studio Code user for the last 2 years, but sometimes when I want to
quickly edit a text file I use vim. More specificly Neovim. 
In this series of posts I would like to document my Neovim configuration along with the
steps to install and configure for different tasks that you would perform with Neovim. 
Mostly I use Neovim for editing text files and work on small python projects, and in the next
posts I will describe each plugin and setup used to configure Neovim.

More details regarding Neovim can be found at https://neovim.io. Below I will enumerate the steps I use to install Neovim on Windwos. 

**Step 1: Install Neovim using chocolatey**

```bash
choco install neovim --pre
```
