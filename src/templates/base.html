    <meta name="description" content="Greetings! My name is Madalin. I am interested in computers and technology in general.
    I live in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the place where I was born.
I had my first computer when I was 12 years old. Soon, at the age of 14, I created the first local computer network. Two years later I had my first job. I worked as a network support engineer. There I first discovered Linux, which I have been hooked on ever since. I installed and tested all Linux distributions available at the time.
It used to be some sort of a sport for me to install and customize a new Linux distribution every week.
With Linux, I discovered bash scripting and that's how I got to programming and the magic things you can do with a 20-line script."/>
