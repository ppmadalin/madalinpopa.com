      Greetings! My name is Madalin. I am interested in computers and technology in general. I live in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the place where I was born.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I had my first computer when I was 12 years old. Soon, at the age of 14, I created the first local computer network. Two years later I had my first job. I worked as a network support engineer. There I first discovered Linux, which I have been hooked on ever since. I installed and tested all Linux distributions available at the time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      It used to be some sort of a sport for me to install and customize a new Linux distribution every week.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      With Linux, I discovered bash scripting and that's how I got to programming and the "magic" things you can do with a 20-line script. I continued with Python, JavaScript, PHP and Java. I used all these programming languages to create small scripts and applications that I used, mostly, in order to automate different tasks. I was also flirting with creating websites, but I didn't even imagine at the time that I would develop a career out of it.
    </p>

      Up to the age of 25, I worked as a network administrator. Then I decided to make a career change and move to consulting as an Enterprise Resources Planning Consultant at Wizrom software. This position gave me the opportunity to discover that I like working with people, to help them find the best software solutions for their companies. I had various responsibilities, from analysis, implementation to technical support. And again, I used the programming skills to make my job easier. I remember when I received an Excel file with 1000 addresses for which I had to fill in the geographical coordinates. I managed to complete this task in 30 minutes using a Python script and the google maps API. The experience at Wizrom was incredible, I met many people from whom I learned a lot, but I decided to move on to my consulting career.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      That's how I got to Oracle. I have been working for 5 years and right now I am a Senior Support Engineer. Here I have all the resources and support to continue my professional development, but also my personal one. In all these years I have been in a continuous learning, obtaining a multitude of certifications.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In 2020 I graduated the master studies in database administration, within the Faculty of Automation and Computers - Polytechnic Bucharest.

      19 years after my first computer today, I believe more than ever in Steve Jobs' quote:
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      "Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think ‚Äù- Steve Jobs
    </blockquote>
